The perfect pre-made list of media queries for all devices; Desktop, mobile or tablet.

Make sure you include this code snippet in your html `head` tag to be able to utilise the media queries.

```html
<meta name='viewport' content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0'>
```

# visualiser.css

```html
<link rel='stylesheet' href='visualiser.css'>
```

On your browser there is a developer tool, 
click that and then enable the responsive design tool to be able to create different viewports to for different devices.
Use this and then resize the viewport to different presets or drag the viewport yourself, 
and you will see different background colors for different device aspect ratios.
